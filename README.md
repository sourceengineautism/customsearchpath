# customsearchpath

allows you to set custom search paths which override all other search types (VPK, folder) for file searching.
effectively recreates the "custom" folder functionality from older source versions.

only tested sigs on portal 2 binaries from the 20 January 2025 update.
made this for windows but is definitely feasable to remake/port for other platforms
